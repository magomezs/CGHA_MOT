Architecture of Multi-Object Tracking with Cascade Global Hypothesis Association Method

The Multi-Object tracking algorithm proposed in this thesis is based on an cascade association method with a global hypotheses generator. 
Moreover, a multi-agent management strategy has been developped to control de flow of the agentsâ€™ information. 
Many other modules has been designed, and presented on this thesis, such as, Human Shape Validation, Detection-by-Tracking, Re-identification, or Feature computation. 
The integration, and conexion of all these developped methods requires of a complex architecture, which has been implemented by means of C++ classes.
